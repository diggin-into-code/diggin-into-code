# Hi, I'm DiggingIntoCode! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an experienced **Spigot plugin developer** specializing in **Java** and **SQL**. I have a diverse portfolio, ranging from full gamemodes to small customizations like temp fly. My most noteworthy project to date is a dungeon gamemode I developed for a French client.
## My Approach ðŸš€

I pride myself on following proper computer science techniques in my approach to plugin development. My main goal is to manifest people's ideas into reality, turning their visions into functional and engaging experiences.
## Education ðŸŽ“

Currently, I'm studying for an Integrated Masters in Mathematics at university, which enhances my problem-solving skills and broadens my perspective on development.
## Open Source Projects ðŸ”§

While I haven't released any open-source projects yet, I plan to share some free plugins with the community soon.
## Get in Touch ðŸ“«
